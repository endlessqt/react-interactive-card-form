# 1. Preview:

The project is highly inspired by that [vue-interactive-paycard](https://github.com/muhammederdem/vue-interactive-paycard) repo.

My idea was to create a form with similar functionality using react and try out neoumorphic design.

## 1.1 Live Demo:

    live demo here

## 1.2 Technologies used:

- SCSS
  - To be honest styling with SCSS feels weird in React project.
- React Hook Form
