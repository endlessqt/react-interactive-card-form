# 1. Overview:

The project is highly inspired by that [vue-interactive-paycard](https://github.com/muhammederdem/vue-interactive-paycard) repo.

My idea was to create a form with similar functionality using react and try out neoumorphic design.

## 1.1 Demo:

### [Live demo](https://interactive-react-hook-form.surge.sh)

To check submitted values check your console. There is no sending data logic.

## 1.2 Technologies used:

- React
- SCSS
  - To be honest styling with SCSS feels weird in React project.
- React Hook Form

# 2. TODO:

- [ ] CSS refactor(god help me)
